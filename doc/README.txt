Testing process: 	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- As explained in Release 1 our Jira is no longer in use. We have instead been using Github's Issue tracking in our Github repository. Which you have access to. "https://github.com/tross78/IFB299/issues"
	
	- Our main form of communication for development was slack where we kept each other updated on our progress and also a discord channel.
	- When bugs/issues were discovered they were first discussed among the group members in our slack development channel.
		- If the bug/issues were a typo or missing bracket etc, it was fixed almost instantaneously (a simple syntax mistake, missing parenthesis etc.)
		- If the bug/issues were more complicated and required new checks, tests, or functionality, then they were recorded by the finder in the Issues section of our Github repository.
		-The users who were assigned to those particular stories that had bugs/issues would then solve the bugs and then test to make sure that the issues had been solved.
		- When the issues were solved, the person who had implemented the fix would close the issue tracking on the github repository.
		- The times it took to solve each individual issue was also commented when the issue was closed so we know the amounts of time spent on each issue.

Manager Login: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our site URL:"https://teamhawk-meditation-centre.herokuapp.com/"

Users can create a new login whenever they want, but they only have the privileges of new students.

It would be beneficial to you as the marker to have access to an account with manager privileges where you can access all the data. Below is the account information for one of our manager accounts.

username: fflintstone
password: 123

When logged in with that account you will be able to see all of the users, courses and enrolments, and enrol in a course in any role (student, assistant-teacher, kitchen-helper, manager). Manager's can also edit other users, set their permisions, add, edit and delete courses and enrolments. They can even edit the enrolments of other students and change their enroled position or classes if they need to.

There are two new permission ranks since Release 1, server and terminated. These were both displayed in the Demonstartion. Students are automatically granted server permission when they have completed at least one 10-day course. Servers then gain the ability to view and enroll in the 3 and 30 day courses, and can also enroll as 2 extra roles: (assitant-teacher, kitchen help). But they don't have the ability to add/edit/delete courses like managers do, and they can only see their own personal enrolments, unlike managers who can see all enrolments.

Terminated acounts are like a blacklist, if you're acount is terminated that if you try to make a new acount with the same email adress it will not allow you to log in. It basically bans that user's email adress from the site.

If you did make an account, and use a real email acount, you will receive email notifications on certain actions as demonstrated during the workshop.

What is implemented: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As far as what is implemented at this point everything we set out to acomplish in terms on user stories in the sprint/release plans for release 2. That document is current and has the tasks recorded with hours estimated and taken for each. There are two minor issues/bugs that remain and they are recorded on our github issue tracking. They are the two issues that are still open. They would be moved back into the next sprint if there was one.
